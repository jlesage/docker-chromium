      - title: Enable Usage of Sandbox
        level: 2
        content: |-
          For security purpose, {{ app.friendly_name }} uses sandbox to remove unnecessary
          privileges from renderer processes. Web content executes in a highly restrictive
          environment, significantly reducing the impact of potential exploits.

          Docker uses [seccomp profile] to restrict system calls available to the
          container. By default, some system calls required to run sandboxes are not
          allowed by the [default seccomp profile].
          
          There are several ways to allow {{ app.friendly_name }} to use its sandbox.
          From the most to least secure:

            1. **Use custom seccomp profile.** This is the most secure approach. Start
               with the Docker's [default seccomp profile] and move the `unshare`
               capability to the allowed list. Use this custom profile by creating the
               container with the `--security-opt seccomp=/path/to/chrome.json`
               parameter.
            2. **Add the `SYS_ADMIN` capability.** This allows {{ app.friendly_name }} to
               use its sandbox, but also adds unnecessary privileges. Create the container
               with the `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` parameter.
            3. **Run the container in privileged mode.** This effectively disables usage
               of seccomp and is the least secure option. Create the container with the
               `--privileged` parameter.

          > [!CAUTION]
          > If none of the above actions are used, {{ app.friendly_name }} will run with
          > its sandbox disabled.
